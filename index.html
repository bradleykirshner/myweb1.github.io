  <button class="collapsible">1. Is javascript (js) array mutable? array methods filter, indexOf, at, splice and slice. Slice is used to get a new array from the original array whereas the splice is used to add/remove items in the original array. The changes are not reflected in the original array in the case of slice; but for the splice, the changes are reflected in the original array. Show one interesting example showing how to use these methods respectively? </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>JavaScript arrays are mutable. </p>
      <code>
        let filteredArray = array.filter(num => num % 2 === 0); 
      </code>
    <p>
    In this example of the filter method, we are setting the variable filteredArray to a version of the array filtered with only even numbers. 
    </p>
    <code>let index = array.indexOf(3); </code>
    <p>  In this example of the indexOf method, we set the variable index to the index of 3 in the array.</p>
    <code>array.splice(2); </code>
    <p>  In this example of the splice method, we remove the element at the index of 2.</p>
    <code>let slicedArray = array.slice(1, 3);</code>

  <div class="content">
    <p>RESTful services enable clients to perform CRUD operations on server resources using standard HTTP methods. REST stands for representational state transfer.
    RESTful API endpoints are URLs that represent resources on the server. They define the entry points for interacting with those resources. 
    Routing is the process of determining how an incoming HTTP request should be handled and which code should be executed to generate the appropriate response. Routing lets developers define the structure and behavior of web applications by directing request to the appropriate resources. 
    Clean URLs are user friendly URLs. They are easy for humans to read. Clean URLs improve usability for users by giving them clear and descriptive links.
    Resources are an object or data entity that can be accessed and sometimes modifiable by clients through the API. 
    Endpoints are specific URLs in a RESTful API that correspond to a particular resource or collection of resources.

      <button class="collapsible">25. Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served. A web page may freely embed cross-origin images, stylesheets, scripts, iframes, and videos. What is same-origin policy? </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>	The same-origin policy is a security feature that is implemented by web browsers to restrict how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with resources from another origin.

      <button class="collapsible">26. Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting. Explain each of these three phases are about. </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The mounting phase is when a component is being initialized and inserted into the DOM for the first time.
    The updating phase is when a component’s state or props change causing a re-render.
    The unmounting phase is when a component is being removed from the DOM.
  </p>
  </div>
  
      <button class="collapsible">27. react Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features (such as lifecycle methods). Briefly explain the purpose of each of the following hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useRefuse, Reducer, useCallback useMemo</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>useState allows function components to have a local state. It returns a stateful value and a function to update that value. This allows for components to manage state without using class components.
    useEffect is used to perform side effects in function components. It runs after every render and can handle asynchronous operations, subscriptions, timers, etc.
    useContext provides a way to consume values from the React context without nesting. It allows function components to access context values that were higher up in the component tree.
    useRef returns a mutable ref object whose current property is initialized to the passed argument. It allows components to keep mutable values that persist between renders without causing re-renders.
    useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing complex state logic. It accepts a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function. It is usually used for managing state transitions in components with multiple actions and complex state logic.	
    useCallback is used to memorize functions in function components. It returns a memorized version of the callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies is changed. It is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of child components.
    useMemo is like useCallback but for memorizing computed values. It memorizes the result of the function and re-computes it only when one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful for optimizing performance by memorizing expensive calculations or data transformations.
  </p>
  </div>
  
      <button class="collapsible">28. React components, state, props, jsx,, virtual DOM, render </button>
  <div class="content">
    <p>React components are reusable modules that contain UI logic.
    State represents the internal data of a component and allows for dynamic updates.
    Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components.
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows for syntax like HTML in React components.
    Render is a method that is used in React components to generate the UI based on state and props.
  </p>
  </div>
  
    <button class="collapsible">29. What are the main purposes of redux, RTK, and RTK-query, rxjs, yjs respectively? </button>
    <div class="content">
      The main purpose of redux is to help manage complex state logic. It enables predictable state mutations through actions and reducers.
      The main purpose of RTK is to simplify redux development and make it more efficient. It introduces utilities like configureStore, createSlice, and createAsyncThunk to streamline common redux patterns.
      The main purpose of RTK-query is to make enhance application performance by simplifying complex data fetching logic. It offers a declarative API for defining API endpoints, automatic caching and invalidation, etc.
      The main purpose of RxJS is to help developers work with asynchronous data streams.  It provides a composable API for working with observables, which represent asynchronous data streams that can emit multiple values over time.
      The main purpose of Yjs is to help build real time collaborative applications. It provides data synchronization and conflict resolution algorithms for shared data structures, enabling multiple users to collaborate on the same document or application in real time.
